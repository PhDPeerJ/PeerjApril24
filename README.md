The filename consider this standard

- T = Number of Threats

The UAVs are created on the simulation. 

To create this dataset you can run this matlab file: CreateDataset.m(folderPath, 500);


# Run

To perform a single simulation, use the file main.m to run. 
To run the complete dataset, run the file RunDataset.m
